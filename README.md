# Description

This is a Full Stack Application that allows user to search for a book and the result can be saved to the user's profile. 

In this assignment, I have taken the starte code that was given and turn it into a fully functioning Goodle Books API search engine built with a RESTful API that gets refactor to be a GraphQL API. This application is built with Apolllo Server and using MERN stack with a React fron end and MondoDB databse, along with Node.js and Express.js.
